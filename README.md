# Hotel Receptionist Chatbot

Welcome to the **Hotel Receptionist Chatbot** project! This is an advanced AI-powered chatbot designed to act as a virtual hotel receptionist. It uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to provide accurate and context-aware responses to user queries. Built with **Haystack** for natural language processing (NLP) and **FastAPI** for the backend, this chatbot offers a seamless and interactive experience for hotel guests.

## Project Overview

The **Hotel Receptionist Chatbot** is an AI-powered chatbot designed to answer frequently asked questions (FAQs) related to hotel services. It leverages two state-of-the-art language models:
1. **Hugging Face Embeddings Model**: For creating embeddings from a predefined dataset (`FAQs.txt`) and retrieving relevant information.
2. **Gemini Model**: For refining the retrieved answers and generating human-like, context-aware responses.

The chatbot combines **retrieval** (from embeddings) and **generation** (using Gemini) to provide accurate and dynamic answers, making it an advanced AI Agent.

## Technical Architecture

The chatbot is built using the following components:

### 1. **Frontend**:
   - A responsive and interactive chat interface built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
   - Uses **Bootstrap** for styling and **SweetAlert2** for user-friendly alerts.

### 2. **Backend**:
   - Built with **FastAPI**, a modern and fast web framework for building APIs.
   - Handles user queries, retrieves relevant information, and generates refined responses.

### 3. **AI Models**:
   - **Hugging Face Embeddings Model**: Creates embeddings from the `FAQs.txt` file and retrieves relevant information.
   - **Gemini Model**: Refines the retrieved answers to generate context-aware and human-like responses.

### 4. **RAG Implementation**:
   - Combines retrieval (from embeddings) and generation (using Gemini) to provide accurate and dynamic answers.

## Features

1. **AI-Powered Responses**:
   - Combines retrieval and generation for accurate and context-aware answers.
2. **Dynamic Refinement**:
   - Uses Gemini to refine retrieved answers, ensuring high-quality responses.
3. **Interactive Chat Interface**:
   - A user-friendly interface for seamless interaction.
4. **Luxurious Design**:
   - A visually appealing design inspired by the ambiance of a hotel lobby.
5. **Real-Time Responses**:
   - Provides instant answers to user queries using advanced NLP techniques.
