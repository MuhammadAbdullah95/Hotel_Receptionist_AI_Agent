## üöÄ Project Overview

The **Hotel Receptionist Chatbot** uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to provide accurate, context-aware answers to user queries. It combines **retrieval** and **generation** techniques for optimal responses.

### Key Components:
- **Hugging Face Embeddings Model**: Generates embeddings from a predefined dataset (`FAQs.txt`) to retrieve relevant information.
- **Gemini Model**: Refines and generates human-like, contextually accurate responses.
- **Pinecone**: Pinecone vector database to store and retrieve embeddings.

This chatbot is designed to be both **intelligent** and **visually appealing**, reflecting the ambiance of a luxurious hotel environment.

---

## üõ† Technical Architecture

The system is structured as follows:

### 1. **Frontend**:
- Responsive and elegant chat interface using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
- **Bootstrap** for responsive UI components.
- **SweetAlert2** for attractive and user-friendly alert messages.

### 2. **Backend**:
- Built on **FastAPI** for high-performance API management.
- Handles chat queries, invokes NLP pipeline, and returns refined answers.

### 3. **AI Pipeline**:
- **Hugging Face Embeddings Model**: Retrieves relevant data from FAQs.
- **Gemini Model**: Generates natural and polished responses.
- **Haystack RAG pipeline** to integrate retrieval and generation seamlessly.

## üîë API Keys Setup

Before running the project, make sure you have the following API keys:

1. **Google API Key** - for accessing Google services (e.g., search, knowledge retrieval).
2. **Pinecone API Key** - for vector database operations (e.g., storing and retrieving embeddings).
3. **Hugging Face Token (HF_TOKEN)** - for accessing hosted LLM models and pipelines.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How to Set API Keys

You can set these API keys as **environment variables** to keep them secure and avoid hardcoding them into your code.

#### üñ•Ô∏è Option 1: Temporary (per session)

```bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY='your_google_api_key_here'
export PINECONE_API_KEY='your_pinecone_api_key_here'
export HF_TOKEN='your_huggingface_token_here'
```

#### üìÅ Option 2: Permanent (via `.env` file)

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project:
    ```bash
    touch .env
    ```

2. Add your keys inside the `.env` file:
    ```ini
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
    PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key_here
    HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token_here
    ```

3. Make sure to load this `.env` file in your Python app (if using something like `python-dotenv`):
    ```python
    from dotenv import load_dotenv
    load_dotenv()
    ```

4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` to avoid exposing keys:
    ```
    # .gitignore
    .env
    ```

### üö® Notes:
- Never share or commit your API keys publicly.
- Regenerate API keys if you suspect they are compromised.
